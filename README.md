# NarrateAStory.com

NarrateAStory.com is a **data storytelling and collaborative research platform** focused on **geospatial technologies, extended reality (XR), crowdsourced data collection, and semantic ontologies**.  
The platform supports the use of **data science and machine learning methods** for organizing, analyzing, and interpreting structured and semi-structured data in a research and educational context.

NarrateAStory.com explores multiple application areas — including **cultural heritage** and **education** — with the aim of supporting **engaging, data-driven learning and knowledge-sharing experiences**.  
It provides an open, participatory space where researchers and members of the public can co-create data, contribute observations, and share stories that help document and preserve global heritage.

## About the Project

NarrateAStory.com focuses on:

- 🌐 **Geospatial technologies** for spatial data representation and visualization  
- 🤝 **Crowdsourced data analytics** supporting descriptive analysis and research workflows  
- 🧠 **Semantic ontologies and knowledge graphs (OWL/RDF)** for structured, machine-readable data  

The platform supports collaborative data storytelling and knowledge sharing across several domains:

- 🏛️ **Cultural Heritage**  
  *e.g., documentation of historic sites, traditions, and practices*

- 🎓 **Education**  
  *e.g., agent-based simulations and data-driven learning environments*

NarrateAStory.com is intended to support **research, education, and public engagement**, and is not designed for clinical, diagnostic, or decision-making use.

## Key Features

### 🗺️ Collaborative Heritage Mapping
An open, participatory approach that enables contributors to co-create and explore geospatial knowledge related to cultural and historical heritage.

### 🏛️ Heritage Data Contributions
Users can submit structured information about heritage sites, cultural traditions, and local landmarks, contributing to a shared and evolving knowledge base.

### 🧩 OWL-Based Heritage Ontology
NarrateAStory.com provides a **formal OWL-formatted ontology** to support:

- 🔗 **Structured semantic representation** of cultural elements (e.g., artifacts, locations, practices)  
- 🔄 **Interoperability** with external datasets, digital heritage systems, and research infrastructures  
- 📊 **Machine-readable data** suitable for computational analysis, knowledge-based querying, and exploratory machine learning workflows

## Features for Contributors

### 📌 Add New Heritage Entries
Contributors can submit data including descriptions, cultural significance, geolocation, categories, and related metadata.

### 🧠 Use Semantic Ontology Tools
Contributions are structured using standardized **ontology-driven schemas**, supporting data consistency, reuse, and integration.

### 🔍 Support for Research & Education
Contributed data may be used to support:
- Academic and applied research
- Educational simulations and learning activities
- Public data storytelling related to heritage, sustainability, and cultural diversity

## Research and Technical Scope

NarrateAStory.com adopts **semantic web technologies, geospatial data methods, and data science techniques** to support structured data integration and analysis.  
Ongoing research explores the **responsible use of machine learning and rule-based methods** to assist with data exploration, pattern identification, and simulation in geospatial and educational contexts.

Any use of computational methods is intended to **support human interpretation and decision-making**, rather than replace it.
