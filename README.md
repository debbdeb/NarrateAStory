## About the Project

NarrateAStory.com focuses on:

- 🌐 **Geospatial technologies** for spatial data representation and visualization  
- 🤝 **Crowdsourced data analytics** supporting descriptive analysis and research workflows  
- 🧠 **Semantic ontologies and knowledge graphs (OWL/RDF)** for structured, machine-readable data  

The platform supports collaborative data storytelling and knowledge sharing across several domains:

- 🏛️ **Cultural Heritage**  
  *e.g., documentation of rare historic sites, traditions, and practices*

- 🎓 **Education**  
  *e.g., data-driven learning environments*

NarrateAStory.com is intended to support **research, education, and public engagement for rare heritage**, and is not designed for decision-making use.
